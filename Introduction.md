# Introduction #

The main goal of this project is to develop a nice and clean (_small and hackeable_) library that provide dynamic markers to existing mapping libraries.

The library currently is on an beta stage, and being actively developed, but it can be used without any trouble.

## Examples ##

You can see some examples about how to use it with other open source projects here.
